# 3d-head-tracking
Python-based 3D head tracking. Uses OpenCV and OpenGL.<br>
Basic idea is that OpenCV gets the relative position of your head to the webcam and rotates a mesh. This should hopefully make the illusion that the mesh is in the air

## Installation
If you're crazy enough to try this yourself, you will need the following dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
pip install pygame
```

## Contributions
Wow! You want to contribute? Awesome! This is what I could use help with:
<ul>
  <li>Add shadow shader, so the mesh isn't a gay rainbow parade</li>
</ul>
